 1. About this library
 This library provides algorithms for processing finite state machines (FSMs), such as, for example,
       - Minimising deterministic or nondeterministic state machines
       - Making nondeterministic state machines observable
       - Building the intersection of two state machines over the same input/output alphabets
 Moreover, the library contains "classical" test data generation algorithms, such as the W-Method and the Wp-Method.

 The underlying methods have been described in Part II of the lecture notes 
      Wen-ling Huang and Jan Peleska
      Test Automation - Foundations and Applications of Model-based Testing
      http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/agbs/jp/papers/test-automation-huang-peleska.pdf
 The material presented in this part of the lecture notes and the associated algorithms implemented in fsmlib-cpp is based on (sometimes quite old) results elaborated by other authors, these are all referenced in the lecture notes. 
 
 We do hope that the algorithms presented here are useful to researchers and practitioners working with FSMs and who are interested in model-based testing and complete testing theories and their application is practise.
 
 2. Structure of this repository
 This repository consists of source code contained in sub-folders of directory [src](src) this folder contains
    - several classes programmed in C++, with the main classes contained in folder [fsm](src/fsm);
      there the main classes are [Dfsm](src/fsm/Dfsm.h) and [Fsm](src/fsm/Fsm.h)
	- utility libraries in [trees](src/trees) and [sets](src/sets) as well as an example program in [main](src/main);
 Some of the algorithms can be executed directly from the main program (if you build this, it is called fsm-main), in order to exemplify what the library functions can do. The library, however, contains also methods that are not exercised by fsm-main program. Therefore it is useful to browse all classes for other functionality that might also be useful for your applications.

Documentation can be found in folder doc/. File 'doc/doxyfile' can be used to create a class documentation using the doxygen tool. This will be quite useful to explore the contents of the library. If you do not wish to create the documentation yourself, you can unpack the zip-archive doc/fsmlib-cpp-doc.zip and open file html/index.html in your browser.
 
 3. How to build the code for different platforms
 
 We have prepared the code to be compiled and linked using the Cmake toolkit. 
 The compiler needs to support C++11. We have tested the code with these compilers: 
   gcc 5.4.0 under linux (ubuntu) - 64 bit
   gcc 4.8.3 under Linux (centos 7) - 64 bit
   MSVC 2015 under windows 10 - 64 and 32 bit
   clang-703.0.31 under MAC OS - 64 bit

 To compile under any of these platforms, follow these steps [some platform-specific parameters are specified below].
	- create a build directory, this will contain the results of the build process (library and main program, object files). For example, this directory could be called 'build' and located in the root directory of the repository.
	- change into this build directory
	- call cmake with the platform-sepcific commands described below 
	- this call creates the build files needed by your compiler (Makefiles, MSCV's files, etc.). Now compile the source code.
	- When you want to run the main program, change into sub-directory main which has been created by the the build process and run "fsm-main" (the files needed by the program should be in the same directory, if it's not, move them there) 


 3.1 Building the library for Linux
 
     For Linux platforms, the debug and release versions need to be built separately, using two different
     build directories. Command
	 
		cmake <relative path from debug build directory to the src-directory> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
     
                
     will create the makefiles for a debug version of the code. Command 
     
		cmake <relative path from release build directory to the src-directory> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
		
     will create the makefiles for a release version of the code. There is an example
     shell script build-for-linux.sh in the top-level directory which creates a directory
     Release.Linux and invokes cmake from this new directory, using the Release option.
     You can copy and modify this script for your preferred build options.
	 
	 
	 For building the graphical user interface as well, the above mentioned commands have to be changed to:
		
		cmake -Dgui=ON <relative path from debug build directory to the src-directory>  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
		
	for debug mode, respectively
		
		cmake -Dgui=ON <relative path from release build directory to the src-directory>  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
		
	for release mode. 
		
 3.2 Building the library and main program for Mac OSX
 
     For Mac OSX platforms, the debug and release versions need to be built separately, using two different
     build directories (just as for Linux). Command
     
	    cmake <relative path from debug build directory to the src-directory> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
        
     will create the makefiles for a debug version of the code. There is an example
     shell script build-for-osx.sh in the top-level directory which creates a directory
     Debug.OSX and invokes cmake from this new directory, using the Debug option.
     You can copy and modify this script for your preferred build options. Also, 
     shell script build-for-xcode.sh creates a directory xcode and invokes cmake there
     to set up an Xcode project for building the library.

     Command
     
        cmake <relative path from release build directory to the src-directory> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
        
     will create the makefiles for a release version of the code.
	 
	 For building the graphical user interface use the following commands instead:
	 
	    cmake -Dgui=ON <relative path from debug build directory to the src-directory> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
	 
	 for debug mode, respectively
	 
		cmake -Dgui=ON <relative path from release build directory to the src-directory> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	 
	 for release mode.
     
 3.3 Building the library for Windows
 
     For Windows platforms, the debug and release versions will be built at the same time. 
	 	 
     First, create a CMake project in Visual Studio Code and import the project files.
     Visual Studio should find the CMake-File in the src folder automatically.

     Then, build the FSM-Lib using "Build All".
