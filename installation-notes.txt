After building the library as described in README.md, please make sure that
the relative path from the executable fsm-main to the resources/TestSuites
directory is "../../../resources/TestSuites" .
To this end, you may need to move the contents of the original build directory 
to a new created subdirectory of build, if the library was build under Linux.
(such that build/main/fsm-main becomes build/debug/main/fsm-main, if the
new subdirectory is called 'debug')

To start executing the test suites, run fsm-main.
